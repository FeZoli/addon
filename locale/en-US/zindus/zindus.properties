zindus.status.failon.gd.conflict.1=<br/>Sometimes you have to do a little 'cleaning' of your Thunderbird addressbook before it will sync.<br/><br/>Google has a requirement that an email address can appear in only one contact.  Your intervention is needed at this point because in your Thunderbird addressbook, the email address(es) listed below appear in more than one contact.<br/><br/>The easiest way to resolve this is: for each address, decide which contact is your preferred version, then delete the other one.  Before deleting contacts, update the preferred versions with any information that you want to keep.<br/><br/>If you open the Thunderbird Addressbook before coming here, you can have both windows open at the same time.  Be sure to check both the 'Email' and 'Additional Email' fields.

zindus.status.failon.gd.conflict.2=<br/>Sometimes you have to do a little "cleaning" of your Thunderbird and Google addressbooks before they will sync.<br/><br/>Google has a requirement that an email address can appear in only one contact.  Your intervention is needed at this point because in your Thunderbird and Google addressbooks, the email address(es) listed below appear in more than one contact or in different contacts.<br/><br/>The easiest way to resolve this is: for each address, decide which of Thunderbird or Google has your preferred version, then delete the other one.  Before deleting contacts, update the preferred versions with any information that you want to keep.  The preferred contacts will then sync to the other side.<br/><br/>If you open the Thunderbird Addressbook before coming here, you can have both windows open at the same time.  Be sure to check both the "Email" and "Additional Email" fields in Thunderbird.<br/><br/>Once you've done this, the next sync should succeed.

zindus.status.failon.gd.conflict.3=<br/>You have encountered a bug at Google.  Suggest you report it.

zindus.status.failon.gd.conflict.4=<br/>Sometimes you have to do a little "cleaning" of your Thunderbird addressbook before it will sync.<br/><br/>Google does not allow contacts to be completely empty.  There are some contacts in your Addressbook which may look non-empty in Thunderbird but when translated to Google are empty.<br/><br/>To fix this, you can edit the corresponding contacts in the Addressbook or move them into a different addressbook so that they aren't synced with Google.<br/><br/>To help you locate these contacts in the Addressbook, their attributes are shown below.  If you don't see any attributes below then the contacts causing the conflict are completely empty - which should make them easy to find in your Thunderbird addressbook.

zindus.status.failon.gd.conflict.quickstart=<br/>If you prefer not to fix this now, you can return to the Preferences page and set the '%1$S' preference to zindus/yourname@gmail.com.  This avoids having to resolve conflicts between Google and your Personal Address Book.<br/><br/>
